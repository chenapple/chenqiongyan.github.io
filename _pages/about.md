I'm Qiongyan Chen, an incoming Ph.D. student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) in Computational Media and Arts (CMA), under the supervision of [Prof. Mingming Fan](https://www.mingmingfan.com/) and [Prof. Corey Xu](https://coreyxu.com/). 

I previously earned my Master's degree in CMA from HKUST (GZ) under the guidance of [Prof. Mingming Fan](https://www.mingmingfan.com/) and [Prof. Ge Lin Kan](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/KAN-GeLin/gelin). My Bachelor's degree is in Biomedical Engineering from Sun Yat-sen University, where I was supervised by [Prof. Changqing Yi](https://bme.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/teacher01/1409716.htm).

My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, Virtual Reality, Accessibility, and Human-AI collaboration. We are working to make computing more accessible and usable to everyone.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you're interested in discussing my work or exploring collaboration opportunities.
